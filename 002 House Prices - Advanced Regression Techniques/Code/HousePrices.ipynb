    "  1. **Understanding the Problem**: Look at each variable and do a philosophical analysis about their meaning and importance for this problem.\n",
    "  2. **Univariable Study**: Focus on the _dependent_ variable ('`SalePrice`') and try to know more about it.\n",
    "  3. **Multivariable Study**: Understand how the dependent variable and independent variables are related.\n",
    "  4. **Basic Cleaning**: Clean the dataset and handle missing data, outliers, and categorical variables.\n",
    "  5. **Test Assumptions**: Check if the data meets the assumptions required by most multivariate techniques."
